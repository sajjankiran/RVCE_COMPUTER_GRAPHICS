As my time at Societe Generale comes to a close, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.

Some of my best memories at SG are from our time on the football pitch. I'll always fondly remember the first football tournament back in 2022 (with our ferocious scorelines) and then in 2023, and all those lovely football evenings in Planet sports. That first game against the RISQ team still stands out—I have to admit I was thoroughly intimidated by Pierre!

It was truly an amazing time, and even though we didn't spend a lot of time together, I was always greeted with a warm smile and great conversations whenever we met in the office! I truly felt like I had a football family here

​In a classic twist of irony, I thought I'd have one last stint at this year's SG sports event during my notice period. Perhaps it was a sign that I shouldn't have ventured onto the pitch without my usual squad by my side. I suffered an ACL tear in the first 10 minutes and am now sidelined for at least a year.

I look forward to recovering and joining you guys for a game, hopefully soon after France win the world cup next summer.
