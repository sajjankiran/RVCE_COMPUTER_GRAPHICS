As my time at Societe Generale comes to a close, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.

I will always fondly remember those peak days when we used to properly follow Scrum methodologies and update Jira tickets sincerely. I particularly cherished our practice of learning something new every day and sharing it with the team after our scrum calls. That spirit made me look forward to starting work and tackling new tasks each day.
But ofcourse there were the equally dreadful early morning/ late-night production issues and weekend infra problems which I hope to forget or atleast look back at and smile with a sigh of relief!

My time on the Isthmus project has been a period of significant growth. Along with working on technological aspects, taking on more ownership and initiative helped me immensely improve my communication skills and confidence. Something which is equally essential in the corporate world but which I lacked in my initial days.
As Nanda always used to say, most people just confidently talk nonsense in meetings, but if you have your technicals and fundamentals are solid, no one can get the better of you.

I was also fortunate to get a chance to take a peek at how different financial instruments, back office operations and regulatory systems work. The knowledge I have gained is truly invaluable.

My only regret is that the Datalake project could not move to production. But I am glad to be moving on before the entire Isthmus project gets decommissioned.

I hope we can still stay in touch and I wish you all the best for the future. I look forward to our paths crossing again.
