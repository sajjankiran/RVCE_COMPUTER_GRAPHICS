As my time at Societe Generale comes to a close, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.

My experience has been one of significant growth, from building and maintaining key services for the Isthmus project to later designing and executing its decommissioning. Seeing a project through its full lifecycle has been a truly valuable learning experience.

I was also fortunate to get a chance to take a peek at how different financial instruments, back office operations and regulatory systems work. The knowledge I have gained is truly invaluable.

Overall, My journey here has been incredibly rewarding, and I owe much of that to the amazing people I've had the privilege to work with.
