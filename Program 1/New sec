As my time here comes to an end, I wanted to take a moment to give a special thanks to each one of you with whom I've had the pleasure to work with closely. 
'Being easy to work with' is one of the most underrated, yet essential skill and I feel incredibly fortunate to have worked with a team that embodies this. That spirit is what made me look forward to starting work and tackling new challenges each day.

My dedication and love towards my work was so profound that I often found myself thinking about our projects even when I was far away. I vividly remember pondering Mahesh, Aadrit, and Sumedha's progress on the decommission design plans while on a Himalayan trek last December. More recently, while literally under anaesthesia for a knee operation, my thoughts drifted to the SDS migration and whether I'd handed over all the necessary information to Sandhya!

They say a good manager is one who is ready to go to war for you, and I was lucky enough to have that in Vishesh. Thank you for your incredible support and guidance.

My only regret is that my unforeseen injury prevented me from saying goodbye to you all in person over the past month. I hope our paths cross again in the future.
​And of course, I hope I'm still on the guest list for the party after the Isthmus Decommission is complete!
​Wishing you all the very best.
