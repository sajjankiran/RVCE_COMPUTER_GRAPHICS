As my time at Societe Generale comes to a close, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Joining the company in 2021, I was still a clueless young graduate fresh out of college, with no idea about the corporate world. 

One can only ever have one first company, and I will forever be grateful that I got that experience here with you all. From Ram and Raghav being patient and approachable in helping me with the setup and the on-boarding process to Mohan being a friendly manager, I had a great and memorable time in the Datalake team!
I was fortunate to get a chance to work on cutting-edge technologies in the new and exciting realm of Big Data, along with the chance to take a peek at how different financial instruments and regulatory systems work. The knowledge I have gained is truly invaluable. 

Your support, friendship, and kindness have truly meant so much to me. My only regret is that I could not contribute much or make a meaningful impact in the project. 

I hope we can still stay in touch and I wish you all the best for the future. I look forward to our paths crossing again.
